// BootstrapLookup is the SINGLE system-resolver call site in the Go
// port. It resolves a DNS server's own hostname exactly once, before
// that server can be used as a transport — sing-box has no bootstrap
// concept of its own (verified by grep over the sing-box 1.14.4
// source: no "bootstrap" in dns/, common/dialer/, or adapter/).
//
// This is the ONLY exception to the fail-closed invariant, and it is
// never a fallback for other hostnames: BootstrapLookup is called
// only from the DNS package's bootstrap substitution, only for the
// configured DNS server's hostname, and a bootstrap failure is an
// error, never a silent fallback. The lookup is debug-logged with the
// hostname and the address count only — never the resolved values —
// and no secret is ever involved.
//
// Fail-closed boundary, precisely: bootstrap applies only to the DNS
// server's own hostname, resolved once before that server can be
// used. Every other lookup goes through the configured DNS server
// and the outbound/detour that server is configured with; DNS
// failure is an error, and there is no system-resolver fallback for
// any other host. RECOMMENDATION: configure DNS servers by IP
// address. An IP-address server needs no bootstrap lookup at all
// (the DNS package leaves non-domain server addresses untouched),
// so the system resolver is never consulted.
